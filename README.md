# Junit-Testing-JACOCO-Coverage

In the above project I have implemented Junit testing for code by passing parameters using different ways possible like JUnitParamsRunner,
Parameterized.class and FileParameters. Also using JACOCO I have shown full coverage is achived by the test cases chosen by me.
